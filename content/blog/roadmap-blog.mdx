Hi!
I am **Himanshu**, currently in my **3rd year AI & DS branch** at SIT, Tumkur.

Two years ago, I was overwhelmed by endless tech buzzwords and didn't know where to start. Today, I've won multiple hackathons, built apps for clients, and learned from plenty of failures along the way. This is the roadmap I wish I had when I started.

## A Little About Me

I am a **full-stack developer** (I build complete websites and apps) and I also know:

* **DevOps** (how to deploy apps on servers so others can use them)
* **AI & ML** (building smart systems using data)
* **Web3** (blockchain and decentralized apps)
* **React Native** (mobile app development)

I know it sounds like a lot — but I just love learning new things!
Right now, I am focusing more on **AI** and **backend-heavy work** (server-side programming).

Here's what I've done so far:

* Won **multiple hackathons** (competitions where you build projects in 24–48 hrs)
* Done **freelancing** (building websites/apps for clients and earning money)
* Conducted **workshops** for juniors
* Given some interviews (failed a few, learned a lot from rejections)
* Preparing for **startups/placements** while still freelancing

This blog is my **roadmap for juniors** — especially if you are in 1st or 2nd year, or even from a non-CS background.

## The Big Picture – What Really Matters

The tech field is huge ,there are hundreds of things you *could* learn.
But to get a good job (or start a startup), you don't need everything.
You just need a **solid foundation + some projects + practice**.

Let's break it step by step.


---

## Here's What All These Technologies Actually Mean

Now let me explain each technology step by step so you understand what you're getting into:


## Step 1: Choose Your First Programming Language

**Prerequisites:** None - complete beginner friendly!

**Start with Java** — simple choice.

Why Java?

* Easy to read and write for beginners
* Used in most companies
* Great for backend development and interview preparation

**But what about C++?**

* If you want to work close to hardware (Operating Systems, Embedded Systems), use **C++**
* But for mobile apps, websites, or AI — **Java is easier and more industry-friendly**

Think of programming languages like **tools**.
Java is like a Swiss Army knife — it works everywhere.

**Learn Java:** [Java Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7pe_IiTfNyr55kwJPWbgxB5&si=JlUq2dN8xkzbAIUU)

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't jump between multiple languages randomly (stick to one for 2-3 months)
- Don't start with complex languages like C++ unless you specifically need them
- Don't skip basic syntax practice - it's boring but essential

---

## Step 2: Learn Git & GitHub

**Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with command line/terminal

When you start coding, you'll write lots of code files.
Git is like a **time machine** for your code — it saves every version.
GitHub is a **cloud storage + social network for code** — you can share your code and work with others.

**Why learn it early?**

* It makes you look professional
* All companies use it
* It helps you collaborate on projects with friends

**Learn Git:** [Piyush Garg's Git & GitHub Course](https://youtu.be/RDxQEzXN8AU?si=cLgm1b4G4cvJWu1Y)

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't postpone learning Git until "later" - learn it early
- Don't just watch tutorials - practice with your own projects
- Don't ignore GitHub profile - it's your coding resume

---

## Step 3: Competitive Programming (CP)

**Prerequisites:** Step 1 completed (basic Java/C++ knowledge)

CP = **Competitive Programming**.
Think of it like **math puzzles but with code**.

* You solve problems under time limits
* You get better at logic and problem-solving
* It helps you crack coding interviews faster

**Practice on:**

* **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)** - Best for contests and rating
* **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** - Great for interview preparation 
* **[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)** - Good for beginners

**My Tip:** Don't ignore this. Even 30 mins daily can make a huge difference over time.

**Learn CP:** [TLE Eliminators Competitive Coding Simplified](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/)

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't jump to hard problems immediately - start with basics
- Don't just copy solutions - understand the logic
- Don't get demotivated by low ratings initially - everyone starts somewhere

---

## Step 4: Full-Stack Development

**Prerequisites:** Step 1 completed + basic understanding of how websites work

This is where you **build websites that actually work**.

Full-stack means you know both:

* **Frontend (what user sees):** HTML (structure), CSS (design), JavaScript (interactivity)
* **Backend (what happens in background):** Node.js (JavaScript server) or Spring Boot (Java server)

Example:
Imagine **Instagram** –

* Frontend = what you see (feed, likes, comments)
* Backend = where photos are stored, how likes are counted, how notifications are sent

You will learn to connect both parts together → that's full-stack!

**Learn Full-Stack:** [Chai aur Code Full Stack Course](https://courses.chaicode.com/learn/Web-Dev-Cohort/Web-Dev-Cohort-Live)

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't try to learn everything at once - master HTML/CSS/JS first
- Don't skip responsive design (mobile-friendly websites)
- Don't build projects without planning - sketch/wireframe first

---

## Step 5: Mobile Development

**Prerequisites:** Step 4 completed (especially React knowledge for React Native)

After learning a bit of React, you can try **React Native** (build apps for Android + iOS using JS).
If you want to focus only on Android, go for **Kotlin**.

**Learn React Native:** [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) 
**Learn Android:** [Android Developer Guide](https://developer.android.com/courses)

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't start mobile dev before understanding web development basics
- Don't ignore platform-specific guidelines (iOS/Android design patterns)

---

## Step 6: Machine Learning (ML) & AI

**Prerequisites:** Basic math (statistics helpful), some programming experience

This is where it gets interesting.

**Machine Learning (ML):** Teaching computers to learn from data
Example: You give a computer thousands of dog & cat photos → it learns to tell if a new photo is a dog or a cat.

**AI:** Using ML + other techniques to build "smart" systems.

Steps to learn ML:

* Learn **Python** - [Python.org Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
* Do **[100 Days of ML (CampusX)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH)**
* Do **[100 Days of DL (Deep Learning)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn)**
* Practice on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)** (real ML problems with datasets)
* Learn to fine-tune models with **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)**

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't skip the math/statistics basics
- Don't just follow tutorials - work on real datasets
- Don't ignore data cleaning - it's 80% of the work

---

## Step 7: DevOps


**Prerequisites:** Step 4 completed + comfortable with command line

DevOps = **How to take your code from your laptop → and run it on the internet for everyone**.

It involves:

* **Docker** (packaging your code so it works anywhere)
* **Kubernetes** (managing many apps together)
* **AWS/Cloud** (where your code runs online)

**Learn DevOps:** [Chai aur Code DevOps Cohort](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-for-beginners-devops-journey/)

Do this after you know development, otherwise it won't make sense.

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't start DevOps before building actual applications
- Don't ignore security basics - never hardcode passwords
- Don't over-engineer simple projects

---

## Step 8: AI Engineering

**Prerequisites:** Steps 4, 6, and 7 completed

This is my focus area.
It's like being a **full-stack engineer + ML engineer + DevOps engineer combined**.
You should know:

* Building web apps
* Training ML models
* Deploying them into production

This is very in-demand in startups and product companies.

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't call yourself an "AI Engineer" without proper ML and deployment experience
- Don't ignore the engineering aspects - it's not just about models

---

## Step 9: DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

**Prerequisites:** Step 1 completed + Step 3 (basic CP) started

This is the bread and butter of interviews.
Think of DSA as **smart ways to store and process data**.

* Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs
* Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming

**Practice DSA:**

* **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** - Best for interview prep
* **[Striver's DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)** - Structured learning path

Solve a few problems daily and you'll get good.

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Don't memorize solutions - understand the approach
- Don't skip easy problems to jump to hard ones
- Don't ignore time/space complexity analysis

---

## MAJOR DON'TS - Learn from My Mistakes

### Academic Mistakes:
- **Don't ignore core CS subjects** (OS, DBMS, CN, COA) - they're asked in interviews
- **Don't just focus on coding** - understand system design basics
- **Don't skip college projects** - they often become good portfolio pieces

### Learning Mistakes:
- **Don't follow every trend** - master basics first before jumping to new frameworks
- **Don't be a tutorial zombie** - build projects without following step-by-step guides
- **Don't ignore documentation** - YouTube is great for concepts, docs are better for details

### Career Mistakes:
- **Don't wait until final year** to start building your profile
- **Don't ignore networking** - connect with seniors, join communities
- **Don't underestimate soft skills** - communication matters as much as coding

---

## Activities to Boost Growth

* **Hackathons:** You'll learn more in 24 hrs than in a whole semester
* **Open-Source:** Contribute to real-world projects ([GitHub](https://github.com))
* **Networking:** Talk to seniors, mentors ([LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com))
* **Events:** Attend workshops, tech talks
---

## Final Thoughts

Take it slow and steady.
Don't get scared by the number of things to learn.

This combination will set you apart from the crowd.

Remember: **Everyone's journey is different**. Some might pick up AI faster, others might excel at competitive programming. Find what you enjoy and double down on it while maintaining a solid foundation.

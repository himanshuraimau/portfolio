# Hello, World!

This is my first blog post using **MDX**.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

<Callout>
  This is a custom callout component!

Here's a simple code example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('MDX');
```

## Conclusion
